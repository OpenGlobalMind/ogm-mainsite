# OGM Calendar

There are several weekly OGM calls:

- Free Jerry's Brain on Mondays at 1:00pm Pacific (very geeky)
- NeoBooks on Mondays at 2:00pm Pacific (writing books)
- Fellowship of the Link on Wednesdays at 11am Pacific (almost as geeky)
- The OGM community check-in call on Thursdays at 8am Pacific (not very geeky)

You are welcome to join any call. Each call has a Channel on our [[Getting on Mattermost|Mattermost]] server (register a username [here](https://chat.collectivesensecommons.org/)). The standing call time and Zoom link are in the header of each of those Channels. 

Also feel free to browse [OGM's recorded calls](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLreQNsM8LqWA2ib_Yfkde8m30ANi0WtJr) on YouTube.
