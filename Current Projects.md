# Current Projects
(Under construction.)

We've created this page to help you find your way to the conversations and projects that best fit you. 

These are the main projects in our community. Each of them has sub-projects, which you will discover when you visit their separate project pages. 

To ask people about all this, pop into our [Welcome Wagon](https://chat.collectivesensecommons.org/agora/channels/ogm-welcome-wagon) channel (on Mattermost, free account; [[Getting on Mattermost|here's how]]). Easier: email this account. 

## Build OGM 
## Weaving the World (and The Big Fungus)
## Flotilla: Tools for Connectors (explanation)
## Massive Wiki
## Trove 

For each: Vision + current activities. Help needed. Mattermost channel(s). Main contact. Project Page. Patreon page?
